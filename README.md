# üì∞ Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

Welcome to the **Fake News Detection** project! This machine learning model predicts whether a news article is **Fake** or **Real** using several machine learning algorithms. The dataset consists of real and fake news articles, preprocessed and analyzed to create a reliable detection system.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project aims to provide a system that accurately classifies news articles as **Fake** or **Real** by utilizing the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Using two datasets - `True.csv` and `Fake.csv`, containing real and fake news articles respectively.
2. **Text Preprocessing**: Clean and optimize text using regex, tokenization, and stopword removal.
3. **Model Training**: Several models are used:
    - Logistic Regression (LR)
    - Decision Tree (DT)
    - Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC)
    - Random Forest Classifier (RFC)
4. **Evaluation**: Each model is evaluated on its precision, recall, and F1-score to determine accuracy.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- **Models**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
- **Google Colab**: All code and experiments are performed on Google Colab.

## üìÇ Dataset

The dataset is split into two parts:
- **True.csv**: Contains articles that are confirmed to be real.
- **Fake.csv**: Contains articles that are fabricated or misleading.

## üìä Model Accuracy

| Model                      | Accuracy |
|-----------------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression         | 98.62%   |
| Decision Tree               | 99.61%   |
| Gradient Boosting Classifier| 99.62%   |
| Random Forest Classifier    | 98.93%   |

## üö¶ Results

- **Fake News Detection** is carried out by applying preprocessed text to the models.
- The project achieves **high accuracy** across all models, ensuring robust predictions.

### Step 4: Commit and Push to GitHub

1. If you have initialized your repository with a `README.md`, simply edit it via the GitHub web interface.
2. If you want to upload it manually:
   - In your terminal, navigate to your project directory.
   - Create a `README.md` file using:
     ```bash
     touch README.md
     ```
   - Copy the above content into your `README.md`.
   - Add, commit, and push the file to GitHub:
     ```bash
     git add README.md
     git commit -m "Add README"
     git push origin main
     ```

### Step 5: Check Your GitHub Repository

Once pushed, check your GitHub repository. Your `README.md` file should now appear on the main page of the repository!
